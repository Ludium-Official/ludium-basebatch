# Ludium: WEB3 TALENT PLATFORM

## Overview
![overview](./images/Ludium-1.png)
The digital native world opens new doors for the great opportunity for talents. For one, it is **geographically agnostic**. Two, it allows **asynchronous** project management. And finally, it promotes **pluralistic contribution**. However, we are still bounded to work in a place at the designated time for one organization.

Ludium believes that the new world begs for a new system. For this, we develop a system that is **accessible, collaborative and trustless** for the liberty of the builders.

## Solution - Talent Matching Platform
![Portal](./images/Ludium%20-%20Web3%20Talent%20Platform_BASEBATCH.pptx.png)

Ludium provides a talent matching platform for builders to 

- **Manage Profiles**: Share social, professional, and project acheivement to prove the builder's status
- **Join Programs**: Apply for programs that provide builder opportunity and receive payment based on the success of milestones
- **Join Community**: Post information and join projects to form a new team

Under the hood, program triggers onchain escrow contract that
- **Takes Deposit**: Sponsors deposit the amount to be distributed to the builders 
- **Aceept Milestones**: Builders submit milestone to prove the completion of work
- **Settle Payment** Deposited amount is paid to the builders based on the agreed milestones

## Ludium is BASED

For Base Bathch, Ludium integrated four different technical stacks from Base Ecosystem:

- **Why Base?**
    - Technical Onboarding: Coinbase Developer Platform(CDP) and other eocsystem projects offer quality SDKs/APIs that enhance convenience and reach out
    - Social / User on Base: Base Network is full of users onchain especially on farcaster that fits the builder / sponsor 
- **Technical Stacks Used**
    - Escrow Contract: Deployed escrow contract in Solidity to BASE Sepolia Testnet. Anyone can deposit amount in $ETH / $USDT / $USDC on BASE to launch a program
    - Onchain Kit: Utilized Coinbase Onchain Kit for social login / KYC. It increase the ease of onboarding especially for the new builders
    - Paymaster: Used paymaster to delegate fees to set up programs. It lowers the barrier of entrance to set up programs 
    - Farcaster: Included a button to post frame on Warpcast to share programs. It will increase the expsoure and to related crowd on Base Network such as [bountey caster](https://www.bountycaster.xyz/)

## Roadmap - Trustless Agent Matching Protocol
![Autonomous Protocol](./images/Ludium%20-%20Web3%20Talent%20Platform_BASEBATCH.pptx%20(5).png)

Ludium believe that the digitalized talent sourcing will gradually substitute the conventional HR industry. For this, we believe that 1) **Adoption of the Agents** 2) **Verifiable Onchain Credentials** 3) **Trustless Contribution Settlement** are the keys to scalable protocol. To that end, we bring TAMP(Trustless Agent Matching Protocol) that is both automated and decentrzlied way of finding the right agent 

![Future is Based](./images/Ludium%20-%20Web3%20Talent%20Platform_BASEBATCH.pptx%20(6).png)

As we move toward more agentic future, Ludium plans to adopt following stacks from CDP

- Base Onramp: For the ease of payment, Fiat Onramp is crucial. Base On Ramp offers smooth payment experience. Once Ludium is deployed on Base Mainnet, it is possible to adopt the stack
- Talent Protocol: For onchain credential on builder profiles, Ludium need to analyze various sources of skill data. Talent protocol provides builder score that can serve as a source of reference  
- AgentKit: Agentic future requires coordination and orchestration of multiple agents each performing it's task both onchain and offchain. For this, Coinbase Onchain Kit can be a go to resource for the Based Future
